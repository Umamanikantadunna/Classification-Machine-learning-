# Classification-Machine-learning-

K-Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm for supervised learning. Where the data is 'trained' with data points corresponding to their classification. Once a point is to be predicted, it takes into account the 'K' nearest points to it to determine it's classification.

a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Tree. You will use this classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then you use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

Logistic Regression, and then, you'll create a model for a telecommunication company, to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that they can take some action to retain the customers.

SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.

SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data is transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane. Following this, characteristics of new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong.
